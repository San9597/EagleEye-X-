🔹 One-Liner

A real-time, AI-powered investor protection platform that scans online promotions, social media, apps, and corporate announcements to detect fraud, verify advisors, and alert investors and regulators with a user-friendly, multilingual interface.

🔹 Project Overview

FraudShield AI+ is designed to protect retail investors and strengthen market integrity by detecting fraudulent activities, misinformation, and scams in the securities market. The platform leverages AI, NLP, and deepfake detection to monitor digital channels, verify advisors and corporate filings, and deliver actionable alerts in real time.

The system includes a mobile-friendly app for investors and a dashboard for regulators, ensuring that both grassroots users and authorities benefit from accurate, timely, and easy-to-understand insights.

🔹 Key Features & Uniqueness
1️⃣ Investor Safety App (Multilingual + Voice + Visual Alerts)

Local language support and voice guidance for retail investors with low tech literacy.

One-click Advisor Verification: Checks SEBI’s registered advisor/RA/IA database.

Fake App Scanner: Upload APK/Link → app compares branding/logo/permissions against known regulated apps.

Fraud Alert Notifications: Real-time warnings on scams (fake IPOs, pump-and-dump alerts).

2️⃣ AI-Powered Fraud Detection Engine

Deepfake Detection AI: Detects manipulated audio/video of CEOs, regulators, or corporate figures circulating online.

Text Analysis AI (NLP): Scans WhatsApp, Telegram, and stock forums for suspicious keywords like “guaranteed return,” “insider tips,” or “allotment.”

Pattern Recognition: Identifies pump-and-dump schemes by linking viral stock tips with unusual market activity.

Document/Image Verification: Scans fabricated SEBI letters or IPO allotment documents to detect inconsistencies (signatures, fonts, metadata).

3️⃣ Corporate Announcement Verification Module

Automatically ingests stock exchange filings.

Cross-verifies announcements with historical data, counterparty info, and public domain sources.

AI Credibility Score: Flags unrealistic claims like sudden billion-dollar contracts.

4️⃣ Regulator Dashboard (SEBI & Exchanges)

Real-time monitoring of flagged frauds, viral scams, and suspicious investor groups.

Market Linkage Alerts: Correlates suspicious social media activity with stock movement.

Customizable filters by type of fraud (Ponzi, pump-and-dump, deepfake).

5️⃣ Extra Features (Winning Edge)

Community Reporting Tool: Investors forward suspicious messages/videos → AI verifies and rates them.

Browser Extension / WhatsApp Plug-in: Alerts users on clicking suspicious IPO/trading links.

Gamified Awareness: Users earn “Trust Points” by reporting scams and completing quizzes.

Privacy-First AI: Scans messages locally on-device (federated learning) to protect privacy.
